######    ANDROID WITH KOTLIN    ###### 
#######################################

# - Anko is a great library developed by Jetbrains along with Kotlin, So instead of

    val forecastList = findViewById<RecyclerView>(R.id.forecast_list) We can do
	val forecastList : RecyclerView = find(R.id.forecast_recycler_view)
	Anko is really cool and can help with a lot of Boiler plate code which we write on Android, whether it be Intent instantiation, Creation of Fragments, Database operations, Alerts and a lot more…

# - Anko provides methods too, like :

        toast(“Hello World”) which is an extension function in itself
        longToast(R.string.helloWorld)
        We can create EXTENSION PROPERTIES TOO! Example later!

# - NETWORKING

        Kotlin provides many extension function which helps do networking operations without using third party libraries.

# - ASYNC TASKS : help take up the load off the UI thread but they can dangerous if not properly handled, plus by the time code reaches onPostExecute() the Activity could be destroyed and our Task will also crash.
		so Anko is here to help us with that

			doAsync() {
			    // Code
			}

# - A little information about Threading :

    - UI Thread has different implementations depending upon the the caller object
    - When used by UI Thread, it wont be executed if the Activity.isFinishing(). Because it wont be safe / good practice to do operations when your activity is not in place.
    - If false at least we know the Activity's destruction has not been triggered.


    ## Java has java.util.concurrent.Future

        Learn more : https://www.baeldung.com/java-future

        - The Future class represents a future result of an asynchronous computation – a result that will eventually appear in the Future after the processing is complete
        - Useful for doing computational intensive operations and remote calls.

        ### See Java Code To Understand Future:

            import java.util.concurrent.*;

            public class JavaClass {
                private ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

                public Future<Integer> calculate(Integer input) {
                    return executorService.submit(new Callable<Integer>() {
                        @Override
                        public Integer call() throws Exception {
                            Thread.sleep(3000);
                            return input * input;
                        }
                    });
                }


                public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
                    JavaClass javaClass = new JavaClass();
                    // javaClass.calculate(3);
                    // Will simply just calculate and spit out the result

                    // To gain control while computation :
                    Future<Integer> integerFuture = new JavaClass().calculate(4);

                    System.out.print("Calculating");
                    while (!integerFuture.isDone()) {   // While not done
                        System.out.print("..");
                        Thread.sleep(500);
                    }
                    System.out.println();
                    System.out.println(integerFuture.get());

                }
            }

            // Other ways to control your Future is using
                .cancel() and there is a isCancelled() method to check if cancelled
                .get(long timeUnit) <- Will throw TimeOut exception if your future doesn't return a value

            // Release the resources with a Shutdown() method

                ## Code example 2 :

                    SquareCalculator squareCalculator = new SquareCalculator();

                    Future<Integer> future1 = squareCalculator.calculate(10);
                    Future<Integer> future2 = squareCalculator.calculate(100);

                    while (!(future1.isDone() && future2.isDone())) {
                        System.out.println(
                          String.format(
                            "future1 is %s and future2 is %s",
                            future1.isDone() ? "done" : "not done",
                            future2.isDone() ? "done" : "not done"
                          )
                        );
                        Thread.sleep(300);
                    }

                    Integer result1 = future1.get();
                    Integer result2 = future2.get();

                    System.out.println(result1 + " and " + result2);

                    squareCalculator.shutdown();

                ## Code Example 2 output :

                    calculating square for: 10
                    future1 is not done and future2 is not done
                    future1 is not done and future2 is not done
                    future1 is not done and future2 is not done
                    future1 is not done and future2 is not done
                    calculating square for: 100
                    future1 is done and future2 is not done
                    future1 is done and future2 is not done
                    future1 is done and future2 is not done
                    100 and 10000

            Since the above process is taking time, to make it Parallel

# - doAsyncResult is something that you can use to get result back from the doAsync {

}

# - DATA CLASS :

     We had POJO Classes in JAVA, they are also simplified.

     Implicitly the methods are generated but we can modify :

        getters and setters()
        equals()
        hashcode()
        copy()
        mapping object to variable

     Copying a data class :

        Since we have immutability in Kotlin, so to create another modified object is a resourceful task hence we have copy() method which is a much more efficient way to do so.
        Example :

            val f1 = Forecast(Date(), 27.5f, "Shiny Day")
            val f2 = f1.copy(temperature = 30f)

            Try to not modify the object and copy it instead if you can.

            There is another practice of creating a Wrapper Class to deal with immutability, Learn more about this.

    >> Mapping Object into Variables

        "Declaration Destruction" when we map each property inside an object into a variable

        val f1 = Forecast(Date(), 27.f, "Shiny Day") , Let's say we have this object

        So if we "Declare Destruct" it, It would be something like :

            val (date, temperature, details) = f1

            which eventually means :

                val date = f1.date()
                val temperature = f1.temp()
                val details = f1.details()

# - Kotlin Companion Object

        There is no static keyword in Java, so you wont be facing issues of referencing a non static from static context
        In Kotlin we have Companion Objects.
        There is no static class, hence we use objects which are companion objects which we can reference from anywhere we want.
        They help implement Singleton Pattern.
        They cannot be declared inside a local class.

                class ForecastRequest(val zipCode : String) {
                    companion object {
                        private val APP_ID = "12312313"
                        private val URL = "https://google.com"
                    }
                }
